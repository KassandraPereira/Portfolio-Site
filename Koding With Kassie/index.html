    <p>Hi, I'm Kassie, a web developer based out of Miami, FL.</p>

    <h1>about me</h1>
    #image
    <p>From Sales Rep to Web Developer a little bit about me...</p>
    <p>My journey to becoming a Web Developer is a little less conventional than most. For the past 12 years I've worked in Sales in the Fashion and Beauty industries, but never felt truly connected to this career path. For years I built websites and blogs using platforms, but never thought about pursuing a career in development and coding until last Summer. As a creative person I love to see my work come to life on my screen and as a forever student I love learning something new everyday. I have finally found my passion and together we can build something amazing. When I'm not creating I'm spending time with my husband and 2 little boys in sunny Miami.</p>

    <h1>koding with kassie on youtube</h1>
    <p>As a person who learns from listening and doing I decided to create a YouTube channel where I could teach others how to learn code in short segments tackling one topic at a time. On the Koding With Kassie channel you can learn how to code in 60 seconds or less.</p>

    <h1>recommendations</h1>
    <p class="sarah">As a student in my Front End Web Development course, Kassandra was extremely hard working and always went above and beyond to make her work stand out. She was always willing to lend a helping hand to those around her and was a natural leader in group settings. I was always impressed by her attention to detail and ability to learn and explore on her own. She definitely has the natural talent and drive to go far in programming and I can't wait to see her work in the future. I cannot recommend her highly enough!</p>
